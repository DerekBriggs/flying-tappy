    h3#joining JOINING FOREVER

    .question Q. What does it cost to join FOREVER?
    p You may join as a guest for free. However to upload and store content you must be a Permanent Member. There is a one-time, $100 membership fee. This includes 2 hours of phone or email support during the first 90 days of membership. Accounts can begin with as little as 1 GB at a cost of $50.

    .question Q. What is a unique sub-domain?
    p The unique sub-domain name is your permanent address on the internet. For $100 you can own your name (example, johnsmith.FOREVER.com) or a family name (example, SmithFamily.FOREVER.com). If you wish to purchase sub-domain names that are not associated with a member account, they are available for $500 per name.

    .question Q. What payment methods does FOREVER accept?
    p FOREVER accepts checks, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express and PayPal. Call 1-888-FOREVER to be placed on our waiting list. We'll contact you as soon as a space opens up.

    h3#changes CHANGES TO YOUR ACCOUNT

    .question Q. I don't have enough storage. How can I upgrade my account?
    p You may upgrade your account at any time. Simply call 1-888-FOREVER and we'll assist you with your GB purchase.

    .question Q. Can I replace my account with another individual if I want?
    p Yes. The account is meant to celebrate the life of a single individual. You may change the individual or the account content at any time. However, you must have permission, legal authority, or personal or familial ties (in accordance with FOREVER's terms of service) if you are establishing the account in a name other than your own.

    h3#privacy PRIVACY

    .question Q. Who can see my account?
    p Account holders can choose to store content at different privacy "layers." You can store your most personal content within a "private" layer where information is only viewable by you. This layer may be used for documents such as your personal journal or will. The next layer is "friends and family,"" where you may share non-public content only with the people you choose to provide access to (e.g. family photos, videos, end of life instructions, and medical records). Lastly, content you designate in your privacy settings as "public" will be visible to any visitor to FOREVER as well as through web searches.

    .question Q. Who can post to my account?
    p Your friends and family will be able to post wherever you have invited them to have access to content. In future product updates, you will be able to permit people to post to your public layer. If they do not have a Permanent Member account, they will need to set up a guest account which will enable them to view and post content.

    .question Q. How will my information be kept private during the uploading and scanning process at FOREVER?
    p You will have the ability to mark information confidential. During the scanning and uploading process, only your FOREVER Archivist will have access to your confidential images, videos and documents that require additional security. Any materials not marked confidential may be handled by any member of our Media Services team. At the end of the uploading process, your FOREVER Archivist will either destroy confidential materials or send them back to you at your direction.

    h3#security SECURITY

    .question Q. How will my information be kept secure?
    p Our service is designed to preserve your content through natural disasters, war, terrorism, and other events that cause major disruptions in society. We have secure, high quality storage at multiple datacenters at geographically diverse locations. FOREVER encrypts the transmission of all files, providing you with the security to store private files such as medical records, ownership deeds, and estate planning documents.

    .question Q. How are FOREVER Boxes Shipped?
    p We use two day priority shipping with Federal Express, insure the contents of every package, and track all packages door to door. We inventory every item that is received. Inside our operations center, we tag and track every item to ensure that once it has been converted to a digital format, every item is accounted for and returned to you.

    .question Q. What happens to my account when I die?
    p Prior to your death, you have the option to designate a succession of three Account Managers who will be able to control and maintain your account into the future. Your Account Managers will be able to maintain your account, within the parameters set by you, so future generations can share in the memories you have carefully preserved. Your Account Managers can designate subsequent Account Managers to ensure that your account continues to be maintained. In the event you do not designate an Account Manager, or the chain of succession is broken in the future, FOREVER will preserve your content according to instructions set by you.
